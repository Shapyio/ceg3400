### Student Learning Outcomes

After successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

1. Demonstrate understanding of modern cyberspace that features a collection of
   heterogeneous, interactive components.

2. Demonstrate understanding of basic cryptographic concepts, their practical impact, and the
   corresponding popular tools/applications.

3. Demonstrate understanding of hardware security, various types of malware and their
   implications, basic principles of anti-virus software and its limitation, and system
   architectures and their security implications.

4. Demonstrate understanding of various critical infrastructures and how the integration of
   interacting components introduces security challenges.

5. Demonstrate understanding of security design principles and their application in designing
   secure, complex systems.

6. Demonstrate understanding of human factors in cyber security.

7. Demonstrate understanding of the need to address cybersecurity from a risk management
   perspective and the challenges of trying to do this.

  * Communicate *EARLY* and *OFTEN*
* Practice effective learning strategies
  * Research topics on your own
  * Begin labs early
  * ***if its not in github, it didnt happen***
* All work is to be your own
  * You can still collaborate with other students about assignments (use Discord and when in d    oubt just ask me!)
  * Generative AI (ChatGPT, etc.) is not to be used on any lab or assignment writeup
  * If using Generative AI on coding assignments document all use and include in your writeup

### Course Communication and Administration

* [CS/CEG Discord Server](https://discord.gg/pMUMzTt)
  * Will be used for office hours
  * Will be available 24/7 for students to collaborate with each other
* Webex
  * May be used via my personal webex room for course lectures remotely (if students are remote)
  * Will be used for 1v1 communication with instructor
* Email

  * F < 60

* Grade Composition / Evaluation
  * 25% - Midterm + Final Examination
  * 25% - Labs
  * 25% - Quizzes

 Students are encouraged to stay home if they are sick.  All
 course content will be available online if the instructor is notified prior to class.  You must  notify the instructor via discord or 
 email if you will be unable to participate on a given day **prior to the beginning of class**.
