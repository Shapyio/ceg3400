# What is Encryption



***Encryption*** is the process of *encoding* information with a purpose (typically for security security).  This process converts the original representation of the information, known as *plaintext*, into an alternative form known as *ciphertext*.

This process, combined with its reverse *decryption*, and all of the data/algorithms necessary to encrypt and decrypt messages form a *cryptosystem*.

# What is Encryption (continued)

Some points:

* Encryption is reversible (with a key)
* Encryption is everywhere
* Encryption does NOT need a computer (but good encryption probably does...)

# Cryptosystem

Five-tuple (sequence) of the following elements:

Element | description
 ---    | ---
***E*** | the set of ***Encryption*** algorithms
***D*** | the set of ***Decryption*** algorithms
***M*** | the set of plaintext ***Messages*** 
***K*** | the set of ***Keys*** 
***C*** | the set of encrypted messages or ***Ciphertexts*** 

***E*** = *f(* ***K***,***M*** *)* -> ***C***
 
***D*** = *f(* ***K***,***C*** *)* -> ***M*** 

---

# Scytale Cryptosystem

Element | description
 ---    | ---
***E*** | wrap around scytale & write *message*
***D*** | wrap around scytale & read *message*
***M*** | the *message*
***K*** | ???
***C*** | strip or paper with letters

# Caesar Cipher

AKA rotational cipher, shift cipher, probably more.  Simple encryption via substitution.

# Two types of Encryption

## Symmetric

Same key for both encrypting and decrypting

## Asymmetric

Different keys for encrypting and decrypting

--- 

# Symmetric Encryption

![symmetric key encryption](img/symmetric-encryption.png)

Keys are identical for encryption and decryption.

---

# Asymmetric Encryption

![public key encryption](img/640px-Public_key_encryption_keys.svg.png)

Keys are different but mathematically related.

---

# Differences

Symmetric | Asymmetric
--- | ---
One key | Multiple keys
Fast | Slow
Used to encrypt various amounts of data | Used to authenticate and initiate symmetric encryption
Key must be secured | only private key needs securing
Needs more keys to establish secure communications within a group | Needs fewer keys to establish secure communication in a group

---

# Apples and Oranges

Although the end goal is the same (end up with *encrypted* data in the form
of a cipher text), asymmetric and symmetric encryption work very differently.

| | **Asymmetric (RSA 2048)** | **Symmetric (AES 128)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Encrypt* spd | 1.5 MB/s | 100 MB/s |
| *Decrypt* spd | 0.4 MB/s | 100 MB/s |  


---

# Public and Private Key pairs

* Public key is public information, can be shared with anyone.
* Assume **everyone** has your public key
* Private key must be kept private
* **Public** and **Private** key pairs share a unique mathematical relation:
  * Anything **encrypted** with the **public key** can only be *decrypted* with the *private key*
  * Anything **encrypted** with the **private key** can only be *decrypted* with the *public key*

---

# Key Pairs continued

If we trust this relationship, and we trust that recorded knowledge of who has what keys:

* We can check *Authenticity* by asking them to encrypt something with their private key
* We can recieve (one way) secure communications (ask someone else to first encrypt with your public key)
* If we send something encrypted with our private key who can read it???

# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Solves the problem of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel.

* The internet is public and filled with many potential eavsdroppers (***Eve's***)
* ![eve](img/eve.png){height=25%}
* How to establish a *secure* communication channel across an insecure one?
